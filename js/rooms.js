            Well, you think it's morning.  You blink a few times and take in your surroundings.  You are instantly startled.  You are not in your bedroom.  You are not even in your house.  What the hell did you do last night!?

You notice a white square box that is serving as a table placed in the center of the room.  You notice an object on the table, but from where you are you cannot tell
            what it is.  On the far side of the room in front of your is a door.  It is as white as everything else.`,
